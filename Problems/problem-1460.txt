You are given an integer nn and a string ss consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'. Consider a string t=s+s+⋯+sn timest=s+s+⋯+s⏟n times, i.e. the string obtained by concatenating nn copies of ss.
Find the number of non-empty prefixes of tt in which the number of occurrences of 'a' is strictly greater than the number of occurrences of 'b'.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains the string ss and the integer nn, separated by a single space. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of valid prefixes.

Explanation
Example case 1: The string tt is "abaaba". It has five prefixes which contain more a-s than b-s: "a", "aba", "abaa", "abaab" and "abaaba".
Example case 2: The string tt is "baabaabaa". The strings "baa", "baaba", "baabaa", "baabaab", "baabaaba" and "baabaabaa" are the six valid prefixes.
Example case 3: The string tt is "bbabbabba". There is no prefix of this string which consists of more a-s than b-s. Therefore, the answer is zero.

Guruji says that gotchi is the answer to all of life’s problems. However, Sartaj knows how potent it really is . 
Given the array of measures of different potencies in a gotchi solution a1, a2…, an. Divide the array into p cups having non- empty consecutive subarrays such that every element of array is included in exactly one cup.
Let g(i) be the index of cup to which ith element belongs to (cups are numbered from 1 to p from left to right).
The gotchi potency value of each cup is determined by following formula  ∑(ai g(i)).
Given  a= [-3, 4, 5, 4,−7, 8, -2 ] and we can divide it into 4 cups in the following way:
 [−3 , 4] , [5 , 4] , [−7 , 8] and [-2 ] then the overall potency value is equal to
 -3⋅1 + 4⋅1 + 5⋅2 + 4⋅2 - 7⋅3 + 8⋅3 – 2⋅4  = 14
Calculate the minimum potency value that Sartaj has to drink .
Input
•    The first line of input contains n (size of array) and p (number of cups) 
•    The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2,…an
Output
Print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum potency value.
Constraints

1≤n,k≤1041≤n,k≤104 
−105≤ai≤105−105≤ai≤105

Example Input 1
5 3
-1 -2 5 -4 8
Example Output 1
17
Example Input 2
7 6
-3 0 -1 -2 -2 -4 -1
Example Output 2
-54
Explanation:-
Input 1
 The  minimum potency value is 17.
3 cups contain:-
Cup1=[-1]
Cup2=[-2, 5]
Cup3=[-4, 8]
Then overall potency value is
-1⋅1 - 2⋅2 + 5⋅2 - 4⋅3 + 8⋅3 = 17
Which is minimum achievable value in following case.

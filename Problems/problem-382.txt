Narayan has recently done a course in baking cakes and with the newly learnt skill he has opened a cake shop. He bakes very nice cakes so the number of buyers of cake in his shop is sometimes record breaking.
Narayan is given the no. of buyers at his shop on N consecutive days. The number of buyers on the i-th day is Bi . A day is record braking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:

The number of buyer on the day is strictly larger than the number of buyers on each of the previous days.
Either it is the last day, or the number of buyers on the day is strictly larger than the number of byers on the following day. 

Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!
You have been a very good friend of Narayan since childhood,please  help him find out the number of record breaking days.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N.
The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Bi.
Output
For each test case, output one line containing y, where y is the number of record
breaking days.
Constraints
0 ≤ Bi ≤ 2 × 10^5
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.

 Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.
Given a string s. Can you make it a palindrome by deleting exactly one character? Note that size of the string after deletion would be one less than it was before. 
Input
First line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.
For each test case, you are given a single line containing string  s. 
Output
For each test case, print YES or NO depending on the answer of the problem. 
Constraints

 Subtask 1, 35 points 
 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤  size of string s ≤ 1000
 String s contains lowercase English alphabets (ie. from 'a' to 'z').

 Subtask 2, 65 points 
2 ≤  size of string s ≤ 10^5
 Sum of size of string s over all the input test cases won't exceed 10^6
 String s contains lowercase English alphabets (ie. from 'a' to 'z').
                        Sample Input 1
                        

4
aaa
abc
abdbca
abba

                        Sample Output 1
                        

YES
NO
YES
YES
Explanation
Example case 1. Delete any one 'a', resulting string is "aa" which is a palindrome.
Example case 2. It is not possible to delete exactly one character and having a palindrome.
Example case 3. Delete 'c', resulting string is "abdba" which is a palindrome. 
Example case 4. Delete 'b', resulting string is "aba" which is a palindrome.

A scientist is performing an experiment. She has to note down the exact time at which N interesting events occur. Unfortunately, she is very tired and misses some digits while noting down the time. Also, she just forgets about the date. 
So at the end, there are n timestamp entries in hh:mm:ss format, where hh denotes the hour, mm minutes and ss the seconds. The time is in 24-hour format. Some of the digits are missing and will be denoted by a '?'.  The scientist has also forgotten how long back she had started the experiment! So, given these N times, what is the minimum amount of time that has passed since the start of the experiment? 
The i-th event always occurs after or at the same time as the (i-1)-th event. The first event always begins at 00:00:00 and that timestamp is correctly noted.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of events.
The next N lines each contain strings T1, T2, ..., TN denoting the N timestamps.
Each timestamp has 8 characters of the form: "hh:mm:ss" (without quotes) denoting the hour (hh), minute (mm) and seconds (ss). Each part maybe prefixed by a 0 to make it fit in the format. Some of the digits in the timestamp may be absent and will be denoted by '?'.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of seconds taken for the experiment to be completed.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
Sum of all N over all test cases in a single test file will not exceed 106

3

23:59:59
23:59:?8

Output:
86400
172798
72001
172748

Explanation
Example case 1. The first event and last event takes place exactly 24 hours apart and all the other event could have occurred between these 2 events. So the minimum amount of time passed is 24 hours (or 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds) 
Example case 3. Since we have to minimize the amount of time passed, we can fill all ? with 0 and assume the second event occurred at 20:00:01

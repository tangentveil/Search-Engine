Chef's apartment consists of MM floors (numbered 11 through MM), and there's an elevator that is used to move between different floors. The elevator is connected with a computer which registers its movement in a sequence BB. Whenever the elevator moves to a different floor, the computer appends the new floor number to sequence BB. Currently, the sequence BB has NN elements.
Unfortunately, the computer is infected with a virus which replaced some elements of BB by −1−1s. Chef now wants to know what could be the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction. That is, how many times the elevator was going up then started going down and vice versa. 
Help chef by answering his question or determine that the sequence BB is invalid.
Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers NN and MM. 
The second line contains NN space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction or −1−1 if the given BB sequence is invalid.

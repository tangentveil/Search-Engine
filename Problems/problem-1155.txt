Chef wants to run a restaurant for NN days (numbered 11 through NN).
First, Chef needs to buy some plates. Each of these plates should have a positive integer capacity. Chef must decide in advance the number of plates MM to buy as well as their capacities (not necessarily the same for each plate). A plate with capacity cc cannot hold more than cc fruits and it is called half-full if it holds at least ceil(c/2)ceil(c/2) fruits. Initially, all plates are empty and numbered 11 through MM.
Chef needs to satisfy his guests on each of the NN days. For each day ii:

On the morning of this day, Chef unlocks an infinite supply of fruit of the ii-th type. He may use these fruits any number of times during the ii-th day and all days that follow.
In the afternoon, he may choose up to 44 fruits and add them to some of the plates. The fruits may be of any types (possibly the same type) and they may be added to any plates independently from each other (possibly all to the same plate). For example, if this is the 55-th day and Chef has 33 plates, he may choose fruits of types {1,1,3,4}{1,1,3,4}, add fruits of types 11 and 44 to the second plate and fruits of types 11 and 33 to the third plate.
By the evening of this day, he must present a single plate containing at least one of each type of fruit between 11 and ii inclusive. Additionally, the plate must be at least half-full, otherwise it would look empty and his guests would not be satisfied.

Note that the same plate may be presented multiple times. When a plate is presented, the fruits on it remain (do not get eaten).
Help Chef decide the number of plates, the capacity of each plate, as well as the types of fruits to pick each day and the plates to add them to. Chef does not need to minimise the number of plates or their capacities, but the number of plates must not exceed 1,0001,000 and their capacities must not exceed NN. You may find any valid solution. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output
For each test case:

First, print a line containing a single integer MM ― the number of plates Chef should use (MM must not exceed 1,0001,000).
Then, print a line containing MM space-separated integers C1,C2,…,CMC1,C2,…,CM ― the capacities of the plates (1≤Ci≤N1≤Ci≤N for each valid ii).
Next, for each day ii from 11 to NN:
Print a line containing a single integer KiKi ― the number of fruits Chef should pick on the ii-th afternoon (1≤Ki≤41≤Ki≤4).
Then, print KiKi lines describing these fruits. Each of these lines should contain two space-separated integers FF and PP (1≤F≤i1≤F≤i, 1≤P≤M1≤P≤M) ― the type of added fruit and the plate to which it should be added.

Constraints

1≤T≤1,0001≤T≤1,000
1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 105105

Explanation
Chef can use 33 plates with capacities 11, 22 and 33 in this order. In the morning on the 11-st day, fruit of type 11 becomes available to Chef. He can transfer 11 fruit of type 11 to each of plates 11, 33 and 22 fruits of type 11 to plate 22. Afterwards, plates 11 and 22 satisfy both our conditions (they contain fruits of all the types till now and are at least half-filled). 
In the morning on the 22-nd day, Chef gets the supply of fruit of type 22. He can transfer 11 fruit of type 22 to plate 33. Now plate 33 satisfies the required conditions.
Then, in the afternoon on the 33-rd day, Chef can add a fruit of type 33 to plate 33, so that this plate satisfies the required conditions. This is one possible solution.

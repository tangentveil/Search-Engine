One day, Tanya was studying graph theory. She is very inquisitive, so the following problem soon came to her mind.
Find the number of undirected unweighted connected simple graphs with N vertices (numbered 1 through N) and M edges, such that for each i (2 \le i \le N), the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex i is unique and its length is equal to A_i. In other words, for each i (2 \le i \le N), there should be exactly one path with length A_i between vertices 1 and i, and there should be no paths with smaller length between these vertices.
Two graphs with N vertices are distinct if we can find two vertices u and v such that there is an edge between these vertices in one graph, but not in the other graph.
Since the answer could be very large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007 (10^9 + 7).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains N - 1 space-separated integers A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of graphs modulo 10^9 + 7.
Constraints

1 \le T \le 1,000
2 \le N \le 10^5
N-1 \le M \le \mathrm{min}\left(2\cdot 10^5, \frac{N(N-1)}{2}\right)
1 \le A_i \le N-1 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
the sum of M over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5

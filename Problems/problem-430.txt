You have an array PP of length NN. Also in front of you, there are NN bags of gems lined up in a row where the ii-th bag from the left has 2Pi2Pi gems in it. 
You can take any bags of gems from them following the given rules:

You are not allowed to take two adjacent bags. 
You are allowed to take at most kk bags.

For each value of kk from 11 to ⌈N2⌉⌈N2⌉, find the maximum number of gems you can obtain.
Since the answers may be too large, print them modulo 109+7109+7.
Input Format

The first line contains TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer NN - the number of bags of gems.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing ⌈N2⌉⌈N2⌉ integers. The kk-th of them is the maximum number of gems you can obtain if you take no more than kk bags, modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation
Test Case-1:

For k=1k=1: It is optimal to pick index: 22. Therefore the number of gems =2P2=8=2P2=8.
For k=2k=2: Optimal selection is exactly same.

Test Case-3:

For k=1k=1: It is optimal to pick indices: 33. Therefore the number of gems =2P3=16=2P3=16.
For k=2k=2: It is optimal to pick indices: 2,52,5. Therefore the number of gems =2P2+2P5=24=2P2+2P5=24.
For k=3k=3: It is optimal to pick indices: 1,3,51,3,5. Therefore the number of gems =2P1+2P3+2P5=28=2P1+2P3+2P5=28.

In Quartzland recently a new collection of toys went on sale. This collection consists of  109  types
of toys, numbered with integers from  1  to  109 . A toy from the new collection of the  i­th type
costs  i  quartz.
Riku has managed to collect N  different types of toys  A1 , A2... AN  from the new collection.
Today is Riku's birthday, and her mother decided to spend no more than M  quartz on the
gift to the daughter. Riku will choose several different types of toys from the new collection
as a gift. Of course, she does not want to get a type of toy which she already has.
Riku wants to have as many distinct types of toys in her collection as possible as the result.
The new collection is too diverse, and Riku is too little, so she asks you to help her in this.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers N and  M — the number
of types of toys that Riku already has and the number of quartz that her mom is willing to
spend on buying new toys.
The second line contains  N  distinct integers  A1 , A2...AN — the types of toys that Riku already has.

Output
For each test case, output two lines as follows:
In the first line print a single integer  K  — the number of different types of toys that Riku
should choose so that the number of different types of toys in her collection is maximum
possible. Of course, the total cost of the selected toys should not exceed M.
In the second line print  K  distinct space­ separated integers  X1 , X2... XK— the
types of toys that Riku should choose.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ M ≤ 109
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
1 ≤ Xi ≤ 109

Example
Input:
2
3 7
1 3 4
4 14
4 6 12 8
 
Output:
2
2 5
4
1 2 3 5

Explanation
Example case 1. Riku's mom should buy two toys: one toy of the  2­nd type and one toy of the  5­th
type. At any other purchase for  7  quartz (assuming that the toys of types  1 ,  3  and  4  have
already been bought), it is impossible to buy two and more toys.

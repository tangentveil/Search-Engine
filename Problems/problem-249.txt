Dr.D got so famous thanks to his first problem that he decided to commemorate it by making yet another problem with an almost identical statement — he only changed one word.
We want to choose exactly two integers (not necessarily distinct) from the interval [L,R][L,R]. Find the maximum possible value of the bitwise OR of the chosen integers.
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LL, RR.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum bitwise OR.

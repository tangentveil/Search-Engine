Gritukan likes to take cyclic trips around the world. There are N countries numbered 1 through N in the world. Before starting his travels, Gritukan chooses a permutation P of all N countries. Then, he visits all countries (some countries may be visited multiple times) using the following algorithm:

for each v from 1 to N inclusive:
travel to country v
travel from country v to country Pv, then from country Pv to country PPv, and so on until he reaches country v again; let's call this sequence of visited countries a cyclic route

(Each country appears at most once in a cyclic route. It is also possible for a route to contain only one country if v=Pv, in which case Gritukan's travel along this route consists of staying in country v.)
Unfortunately, Gritukan does not remember the routes he took. He only remembers a sequence A1..N with the following meaning: for each country v, the number of cyclic routes which contained this country is Av. Given the sequence A, Gritukan asks you to calculate the number of permutations P consistent with this sequence, modulo 998244353 (it's prime).
Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN. 

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of possible permutations modulo 998244353 (it's prime).
Constraints

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤106
1≤Ai≤N for each valid i
